title: Descending through a Crowded Valley - Benchmarking Deep Learning Optimizers
abstract: 'Choosing the optimizer is considered to be among the most crucial design
  decisions in deep learning, and it is not an easy one. The growing literature now
  lists hundreds of optimization methods. In the absence of clear theoretical guidance
  and conclusive empirical evidence, the decision is often made based on anecdotes.
  In this work, we aim to replace these anecdotes, if not with a conclusive ranking,
  then at least with evidence-backed heuristics. To do so, we perform an extensive,
  standardized benchmark of fifteen particularly popular deep learning optimizers
  while giving a concise overview of the wide range of possible choices. Analyzing
  more than 50,000 individual runs, we contribute the following three points: (i)
  Optimizer performance varies greatly across tasks. (ii) We observe that evaluating
  multiple optimizers with default parameters works approximately as well as tuning
  the hyperparameters of a single, fixed optimizer. (iii) While we cannot discern
  an optimization method clearly dominating across all tested tasks, we identify a
  significantly reduced subset of specific optimizers and parameter choices that generally
  lead to competitive results in our experiments: Adam remains a strong contender,
  with newer methods failing to significantly and consistently outperform it. Our
  open-sourced results are available as challenging and well-tuned baselines for more
  meaningful evaluations of novel optimization methods without requiring any further
  computational efforts.'
