title: Leveraging Language to Learn Program Abstractions and Search Heuristics
abstract: 'Inductive program synthesis, or inferring programs from examples of desired
  behavior, offers a general paradigm for building interpretable, robust, andgeneralizable
  machine learning systems. Effective program synthesis depends on two key ingredients:
  a strong library of functions from which to build programs, and an efficient search
  strategy for finding programs that solve a given task. We introduce LAPS (Language
  for Abstraction and Program Search), a technique for using natural language annotations
  to guide joint learning of libraries and neurally-guided search models for synthesis.
  When integrated into a state-of-the-art library learning system (DreamCoder), LAPS
  produces higher-quality libraries and improves search efficiency and generalization
  on three domains {–} string editing, image composition, and abstract reasoning about
  scenes {–} even when no natural language hints are available at test time.'
