title: Tight Bounds on the Smallest Eigenvalue of the Neural Tangent Kernel for Deep
  ReLU Networks
abstract: 'A recent line of work has analyzed the theoretical properties of deep neural
  networks via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). In particular, the smallest eigenvalue
  of the NTK has been related to the memorization capacity, the global convergence
  of gradient descent algorithms and the generalization of deep nets. However, existing
  results either provide bounds in the two-layer setting or assume that the spectrum
  of the NTK matrices is bounded away from 0 for multi-layer networks. In this paper,
  we provide tight bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of NTK matrices for deep ReLU
  nets, both in the limiting case of infinite widths and for finite widths. In the
  finite-width setting, the network architectures we consider are fairly general:
  we require the existence of a wide layer with roughly order of $N$ neurons, $N$
  being the number of data samples; and the scaling of the remaining layer widths
  is arbitrary (up to logarithmic factors). To obtain our results, we analyze various
  quantities of independent interest: we give lower bounds on the smallest singular
  value of hidden feature matrices, and upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of
  input-output feature maps.'

- comment: An updated version corrects a mistake in the argument of Lemma 5.4, which also affects Lemma 5.5. These two Lemmas have been edited and the corresponding proofs corrected. All the other results remain untouched.
